# 6208-3D-graphics
This is a project written for my final year 3D graphics course. It features rudimentary lighting based on an array of light objects, various materials (some animated), day/night cycle, spline based path movement for objects and procedural terrain featuring chunks.

Of particular note are the latter two features, the procedural terrain generation, and spline based path movement.

## This project must be run in Win32 mode.
