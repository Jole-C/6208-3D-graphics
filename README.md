# 6208-3D-graphics
This is a project written for my final year 3D graphics course. It features rudimentary lighting based on an array of light objects, various materials (some animated), day/night cycle, spline based path movement for objects and procedural terrain featuring chunks.

Of particular note are the latter two features, the procedural terrain generation, and spline based path movement.

# Keep note of the following:
- This project must be run in Win32 mode.
- The vcxproj.zip file must be unzipped. This is due to perforce. Find it in Applications\6208COMP-Coursework-Template
- 6208-Coursework-Template must be set as the startup project.
- All .cpp and .h files must be reincluded within Applications\6208COMP-Coursework-Template\ (right click > add > existing item > all .cpp all .h)
